# *In silico* Analysis of the Human **GHRL** Gene Promoter

This project characterizes the putative promoter region of the **GHRL** (ghrelin) gene in humans, integrating bioinformatic analysis, evolutionary conservation, and epigenetic profiling. The goal is to identify key regulatory elements and their potential role in tissue-specific ghrelin expression and gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia.

## 📌 Objectives
- Retrieve validated promoter sequences (EPD, UCSC).
- Predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using JASPAR and TRANSFAC.
- Assess evolutionary conservation (phastCons, phyloP).
- Integrate epigenetic data (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq) from ENCODE.
- Generate reproducible visualizations and metrics.
