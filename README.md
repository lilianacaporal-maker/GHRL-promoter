# GHRL-promoter

This repository contains resources to study the promoter region of the human **GHRL** (ghrelin) gene, including:

- **Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction** using JASPAR and TRANSFAC matrices.
- **Evolutionary conservation analysis** with phastCons and phyloP scores.
- **Epigenetic profiling** (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, DNase, ATAC-seq) using ENCODE data.
- **Functional enrichment analysis** for predicted transcription factors.
- **Visualization scripts** for motifs, conservation tracks, and epigenetic marks.
