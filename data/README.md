## File Information
- **File name:** `GHRL_promoter.fa`
- **Description:** Human *GHRL* gene promoter region (−1000 bp upstream and +100 bp downstream of the transcription start site, TSS).
- **Coordinates:** `chr3:10,290,734-10,291,834` (GRCh38), strand: **−**
- **Source:** [EPD Database](https# How to Obtain the Sequence
1. Go to EPD Database.
2. Search for **GHRL (human)**.
3. Select the validated TSS and download the sequence in **FASTA** format.
4. Save the file as `GHRL_promoter.fa` in this folder.

## Important Note
This repository **does not include the FASTA file** to keep it lightweight and avoid duplication of publicly available data.  
Please download the sequence directly from the official source.
