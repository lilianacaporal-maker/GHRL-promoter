This folder should contain the promoter sequence used for the analysis:

- **File name:** `GHRL_promoter.fa`
- **Description:** Human GHRL gene promoter region (−1000 bp upstream and +100 bp downstream of the transcription start site, TSS).
- **Coordinates:** chr3:10290734 (GRCh38), strand −
- **Source:** [EPD Database](https to Download
1. Go to EPD.
2. Search for **GHRL** (human).
3. Select the validated TSS and download the sequence in FASTA format.
4. Save the file as `GHRL_promoter.fa` in this folder.

**Note:** This repository does not include the FASTA file to keep it lightweight and avoid duplication of publicly available data.
